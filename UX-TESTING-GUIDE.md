# UX Testing Guide - DonateEquity Platform

Welcome to the DonateEquity UX testing environment! This guide will help you test all three user roles without needing multiple email accounts.

- 9 workflow tasks assigned to the appropriate roles

### 2. Access the Application

Navigate to your staging environment URL (or `http://localhost:3000` for local testing).

### Can't log in?
- Verify you're using the correct email/password
- Check that the seed script ran successfully

### Don't see any data?
- Make sure you logged in with the correct account
- Check that the seed script completed without errors
- Verify you're on the correct environment (staging, not production)

### Tasks aren't working?
- Check task dependencies - many tasks are blocked by earlier tasks
- Verify you're logged in as the correct role for that task
- Try refreshing the page

### Need to reset everything?

## üéØ Key Testing Goals

Focus on:

1. **User Flow Clarity** - Can users understand what to do next?
2. **Task Management** - Does the task system make sense?
3. **Role Separation** - Does each role see appropriate information?
4. **Document Workflow** - Is uploading/reviewing documents intuitive?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **This is a testing environment** - Data may be reset periodically
- **Don't use real personal information** - Use test data only
- **Don't test email flows** - Pre-seeded accounts bypass email verification
- **Focus on UX, not invitations** - Invitation flows require multiple real emails
- **Log out between role switches** - To see each perspective clearly
